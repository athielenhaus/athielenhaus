Hello, Iâ€™m Arne. Thanks for visiting my profile.

I develop __data science and machine learning__ solutions, leveraging several years of experience working in data, project management, quality assurance and marketing roles.

My fields of interest include Education & Training, Languages, Sustainable Supply Chains, Renewable Energy, Mobility, Sharing Economy, and sustainability in general. I am happy to dedicate time to non-profit and social impact projects (please DM me). 

Here are some of my recent projects:

__Predicting housing prices in King County:__  
For this project I use extensive EDA, feature extraction / engineering and Linear Models to predict housing prices.  
[see repository](https://github.com/athielenhaus/Housing-Price-Prediction/tree/main)

__Document Chatbot:__   
I use the OpenAI API, LangChain, Chunking, OpenEmbeddings, a FAISS vector database and Streamlit to create a (live) LLM and RAG facilitated document chatbot which answers questions about your uploaded PDF files.
[see repository]([https://github.com/athielenhaus/Housing-Price-Prediction/tree/main](https://github.com/athielenhaus/LLM-facilitated-AI-assistant-for-Document-Analysis))

__Recognizing cursor handwriting:__  
Ok... this project _does_ use MNIST (:vomiting_face:... I know). BUT it also deploys the model to a live website, includes some gamification, _and_ uses OpenCV image processing to recognize your horrible cursor scribbles.
