Hello, Iâ€™m Arne. Thanks for visiting my profile.

I do __data analytics, data engineering and machine learning__ and __manage digital products and processes__, leveraging several years of experience working in data, project management, quality assurance and marketing roles.

I am happy to dedicate time to non-profit and social impact projects (please DM me). 

__What am I up to lately? Here are some of my current & recent projects:__  

__Extracting useful features from Job Postings:__  
I use the OpenAI API to parse job postings and determine if they have contents of particular interest to users. Click below to see if ChatGPT and I can do better than _Indeed_.  
[see repository](https://github.com/athielenhaus/ChatGPT-assisted-parsing-of-job-postings)

__Predicting housing prices in King County:__  
In this project I do extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), do feature extraction / engineering, test different Linear Models to predict housing prices, and also learn about Queen Anne architecture.  
[see repository](https://github.com/athielenhaus/Housing-Price-Prediction/tree/main)

__Document Chatbot:__   
I use the OpenAI API, LangChain, Chunking, OpenEmbeddings, a FAISS vector database and Streamlit to create a (live) LLM- and retrieval augmented generation (RAG)-facilitated document chatbot which answers questions about your uploaded PDF files.  
[see repository](https://github.com/athielenhaus/LLM-facilitated-AI-assistant-for-Document-Analysis)

__Recognizing cursor handwriting for math questions:__  
Full disclosure: this project _does_ use MNIST. BUT it also deploys the model to a live website, includes some gamification, _and_ uses OpenCV image processing to recognize atrocious cursor scribbles. Check it out and let me know what you think.
